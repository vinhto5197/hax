# Project context

## One-liner
Build **hax**: an AI-first product where the primary interface is a **chat experience** that answers user questions using the user’s own data + context.

## The MVP outcome
Ship a working vertical slice where a user can:
1) Get into the app (basic auth / session)
2) Provide or connect data (even if it’s just a seed dataset at first)
3) Ask questions in chat
4) Receive useful answers grounded in that data
5) See key outputs in a simple **table / structured view** (not only free-form text)

## What “good” means for MVP
- The chat reliably produces:
  - a direct answer that understands context of user's data from previous conversations
  - a short explanation of what data it used (high level)
  - a structured output when helpful (table-like results)
- The product feels cohesive (not a collection of demos)
- We can iterate fast: adding new data sources, new question types, and new agent capabilities without rewriting everything

## Non-goals
- Perfect agent autonomy or complex multi-agent orchestration
- Over-optimized architecture
- Full enterprise security/compliance (but we still avoid obvious foot-guns like logging secrets)

## Guiding principles
- Working software > perfect abstractions
- Prefer minimal, testable vertical slices
- Treat user data as sensitive by default
